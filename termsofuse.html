21.    Governing Law; Miscellaneous. 

This Agreement and your use of the Services is governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of North Carolina (notwithstanding the state's conflict of laws provisions) applicable to contracts made, executed and wholly performed in North Carolina, and, for the purposes of any and all legal or equitable actions, you specifically agree and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the State and Federal Courts situated in the State and County of North Carolina and agree you shall not object to such jurisdiction or venue on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, forum non conveniens or otherwise.
IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED TO ENFORCE ANY RIGHT OR OBLIGATION OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY NOW HAVE OR HEREAFTER POSSESS TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EACH OF YOU AND GOLOCO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.
This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and GoLoCo concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. This Agreement cannot be changed orally. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. The terms “include,” “includes,” and “including,” whether or not capitalized, mean “include, but are not limited to,” “includes, but is not limited to,” and “including, but not limited to,” respectively and are to be construed as inclusive, not exclusive.  Any provision which must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of this Agreement; however, no action arising out of this Agreement or your use of the Services, regardless of form or the basis of the claim, may be brought by you more than one year after the cause of action has arisen (or if multiple causes, from the date the first such cause arose). The failure of GoLoCo to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

You acknowledge, consent and agree that GoLoCo may access and disclose your account and registration information if required to do so by law or if based on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to comply with the legal process, enforce the Agreement, response to claims that any content or information violates the rights to any third party, respond to customer service requests, or otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of GoLoCo, its users or third parties.
To the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms shall govern.
